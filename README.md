# HighRiseDeveloper
Resurrecting the tower simulation game a group of us started in SF.
Start with the ground floor and grow your tower to new heights. Based on an old game with added features.
Code is in C++ and intended for Linux and Windows systems. A C# version was forked privately but never took off.
